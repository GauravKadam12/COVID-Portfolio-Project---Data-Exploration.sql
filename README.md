# COVID-Portfolio-Project---Data-Exploration.sql

Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive COVID-19 data exploration project, showcasing my skills in SQL and data analysis. The project focuses on extracting insights from a dataset related to the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing SQL queries to answer key questions and visualize trends.
Key Features

    Data Extraction: Leveraging SQL, this project extracts pertinent information from the COVID-19 dataset, including cases, deaths, recoveries, and other relevant metrics.

    Data Analysis: Through SQL queries, I have performed data analysis to understand the progression of the pandemic over time, identify hotspots, and analyze various factors contributing to the spread.

    Visualizations: The project includes interactive visualizations that provide a clear representation of the data's insights. Visualizations are created using tools such as Excel, Power BI, or other suitable platforms.

    Insightful Queries: SQL queries are used to address specific questions, such as the impact of interventions, the correlation between different factors, and comparisons between regions.
